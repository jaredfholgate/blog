            <p>I've been working in software engineering since about 2001, although I had a passion for IT since we got our first BBC Micro when was a kid. Following university, I started out at a large Brewery in Leeds in the UK, which has since been closed down (nothing to do with my coding skills!). Since then I've worked in various companies, covering both product and enterprise IT. I've lived in various places during that time too, including the UK, the Cayman Islands and Montreal in Canada.</p>
            <p>My technology passions are DevOps, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. Over the last 14 years, I've worked with vaious technologies over that time, starting with Cruise Control and hand crafted tools and evolving the technologies and skills over time.</p>
            <p>With so many emerging technologies and practices, it's an exciting time to be involved in Software Engineering and technology in general, I look forward to seeing what the next few years bring.</p>
            <p>Outside work I enjoy spending time with family, running (when I'm not injured), hiking, diving, reading science fiction and technology books. Oh, and writing a blog if I keep it up!...</p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy the articles.</p>
