Windows Explorer then automatically removes the dot at the end and you are good to go.\r\n\r\n![Solution Part 1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/68qcus8s39rztgm/Solution1.PNG?raw=1 \"Solution Part 1\")\r\n\r\n![Solution Part 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0vj5340fhzrv87i/Solution2.PNG?raw=1 \"Solution Part 2\")\r\n\r\nSimple when you know how!",
